# Step 1: Use an official Maven image as a build environment
FROM maven:3.8.5-openjdk-11 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the pom.xml and download dependencies (to leverage Docker cache)
COPY pom.xml .

# Step 4: Run Maven to download dependencies (without compiling the code yet)
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Step 5: Copy the source code and compile the project
COPY src /app/src
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Step 6: Use a smaller image (based on OpenJDK) to run the application
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Step 7: Copy the compiled .war file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/my-web-app.war

# Step 8: Expose port (Tomcat usually runs on 8080)
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 9: Start Tomcat (or any server you are using) to run the application
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
